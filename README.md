# Clytemnestra and the Women
St. John's College 2018 Freshmen Seminar Paper on *Agamemnon*, by Aeschylus.
Written by Shen Zhou Hong.

## Summary
In Aeschylus's *Agamemnon*, the character of Clytemnestra consistently
confronts the gender-norms of Homeric literature. Her man-like behaviour is
noted by the townsmen of Argos, and eventually culminates in the slaying of
her husband Agamemnon, on his return back from Troy. Clytemnestra's remorseless
speech and audacious actions is contrasted with the meek deliberations of the
Argive townsmen, who falter at the screams of their king. This essay seeks to
examine how Clytemnestra's pursuit of justice requires a subversion of her
role as a woman in the norms of Homeric literature, and how by righting the
sacrifice of Iphigenia through the mete of blood, Clytemnestra acts in the
role of the (male) Homeric hero instead.

### Parts of the thesis
- Examining the gender norms of Homeric literature, especially the norms of
  women.
  - Look at the Illiad, and the characters of Briseis and Chryseis.
  - Compare Helen's relative passivity.
  - Note how a woman's status is secondary to a man's, especially when it is
    substantiated by the Chorus at `258`.
  - Show how a women's "eager to lend credence to rumours" as said by a
    townsman in `483`.

- Show how Clytemnestra acts out of line with said norms, particularly where
  the Argive townsmen comment on such 'man-like' behaviour.
  - The signal beacons set up by Clytemnestra, and the scepticism of her news
    at the hands of the Argive townsmen.
  - The "spoken wisely like a man" remark at `351`.
  - Particularly when Clytemnestra chides the Argive townsmen for not
    believing in her at `590`.
- Examine the pursuit of justice in Homeric literature, and how it is almost
  entirely relegated as a man's pursuit.
  - In the Iliad, it is the men who seek out justice for the kidnapping of
    Helen.
  - Likewise in the Odyssey, it is also Odysseus who enacts revenge upon
    the suitors.
- Show how Clytemnestra acts in contrary to such establishment, and literally
  seeks justice in her own hands.
