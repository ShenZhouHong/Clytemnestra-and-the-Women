# Clytemnestra and the Women
St. John's College 2018 Freshmen Seminar Paper on *Agamemnon*, by Aeschylus.
Written by Shen Zhou Hong.

## Summary
In Aeschylus's *Agamemnon*, the character of Clytemnestra consistently
confronts the gender-norms of Homeric literature. Her man-like behaviour is
noted by the townsmen of Argos, and eventually culminates in the slaying of
her husband Agamemnon, on his return back from Troy. Clytemnestra's remorseless
speech and audacious actions is contrasted with the meek deliberations of the
Argive townsmen, who falter at the screams of their king. This essay seeks to
examine how Clytemnestra's pursuit of justice requires a subversion of her
role as a woman in the norms of Homeric literature, and how by righting the
sacrifice of Iphigenia through the mete of blood, Clytemnestra acts in the
role of the (male) Homeric hero instead.
