# Clytemnestra and the Women
[**St. John's College**](https://sjc.edu/)
2018 Freshmen Seminar Paper on *Agamemnon*, by Aeschylus.
Written by Shen Zhou Hong [`<shong@sjc.edu>`](mailto:shong@sjc.edu)

## Summary
The Aeschylus's Homeric play *Agamemnon* is set in a world where the status of
women is consistently placed beneath that of men. Despite this, the character of
Clytemnestra consistently confronts, and challenges the inequitable gender-norms
set forth in Agamemnon. Her *"man-like"* behavior is noted by the townsmen of
Argos, and eventually culminates to a high point, in her slaying of her husband
Agamemnon. The killing of Agamemnon becomes the definite moment where
Clytemnestra ceases to conform within the norms of womanhood, and acts in the
stead of a male hero, seeking justice through revenge.

## Parts of the thesis
### What are the gender norms for women in Aeschylus's *Agamemnon*?
Begin by examining the gender norms set forth in *Agamemnon*, especially the
norms of women in contrast to men:
- Start with an enumeration of every instance where the norms of womanhood are
  displayed or enforced:
  - **Line # `258`:** The Herald which greets Clytemnestra subtly hints at the
    secondary status of a woman to a man's.
  - **Line # `275`:** The Argive townsmen persistently doubt Clytemnestra's
    news about the sacking of Troy.
  - **Line # `480`:** Argive townsmen discuss amongst themselves the news of
    Troy's sacking, and many are dismissive of Clytemnestra, solely over the
    fact that she is a woman.
  - **Line # `810`:** *"... and in a woman's cause it hath been laid low"* ---
    Agamemnon compares the sacking of Troy to the rape of a woman.
- *Possible additions:* Briefly look at the role of women in other Homeric
  stories like the Iliad and the Odyssey.
- Briefly enumerate the norms of manhood which are displayed or enforced:
  - **Line # `355`:** When Clytemnestra eloquently explains her system of
    messengers and fire beacons, the Herald compares her speech to that of an
    *"prudent man"*.

### How does Clytemnestra challenge and surpass these gender norms?
Through textual evidence, show how Clytemnestra challenges the norms set forth
in *Agamemnon*
- **Line # `275`:** In response to the doubts of the Argive townsmen, rather
  than yielding assent, Clytemnestra vocally refutes their misgivings.
- **Line # `350`:** The Argive townsmen comments on her speech about her signal
  beacons, saying that she has "spoke like a man".
- **Line # `600`:** After the arrival of the Herald, the Argive townsmen sends
  the Herald to relate the news of the sacking of Troy. Clytemnestra refuses to
  let him repeat it, and chides the Argive townsmen for not believing her.
  - In response to this reproach, the Herald says that the speech is
    `un-wifelike` (**Line # `613`**).
- **Line # `941`:** In Clytemnestra's scene where she urges Agamemnon to step on
  the tapestries, her forceful persuasion causes Agamemnon to comment "Surely
  tis' not a woman's part to be fond of contest".

### How does Clytemnestra's killing of Agamemnon relate to the role of her gender?
- Examine the pursuit of justice in Homeric literature, and how it is almost
  entirely relegated as a man's pursuit.
  - In the Iliad, it is the men who seek out justice for the kidnapping of
    Helen.
  - Likewise in the Odyssey, it is also Odysseus who enacts revenge upon
    the suitors.
- Show how Clytemnestra acts in contrary to such establishment, and literally
  seeks justice in her own hands.
