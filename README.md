# Clytemnestra and the Women
[**St. John's College**](https://sjc.edu/)
2018 Freshmen Seminar Paper on *Agamemnon*, by Aeschylus.
Written by Shen Zhou Hong [`<shong@sjc.edu>`](mailto:shong@sjc.edu)

## Summary
In Aeschylus's *Agamemnon*, the character of Clytemnestra consistently
confronts the gender-norms set forth in Agamemnon. Her man-like behavior is
noted by the townsmen of Argos, and eventually culminates in the slaying of
her husband Agamemnon, on his return back from Troy. Clytemnestra's
remorseless speech and audacious actions is contrasted with the meek
deliberations of the Argive townsmen, who falter at the screams of their king.
This essay seeks to examine how Clytemnestra's pursuit of justice requires a
subversion of her role as a woman in the norms of set forth in the play, and how
by righting the sacrifice of Iphigenia through the mete of blood, Clytemnestra
transcends her expectations of womanhood.

## Parts of the thesis
### What are the gender norms for women in Aeschylus's *Agamemnon*?
Begin by examining the gender norms set forth in *Agamemnon*, especially the
norms of women in contrast to men:
- Start with an enumeration of every instance where the norms of womanhood are
  displayed or enforced:
  - **Line # `258`:** The Herald which greets Clytemnestra subtly hints at the
    secondary status of a woman to a man's.
  - **Line # `275`:** The Argive townsmen persistently doubt Clytemnestra's
    news about the sacking of Troy.
  - **Line # `480`:** Argive townsmen discuss amongst themselves the news of
    Troy's sacking, and many are dismissive of Clytemnestra, solely over the
    fact that she is a woman.
  - **Line # `810`:** *"... and in a woman's cause it hath been laid low"* ---
    Agamemnon compares the sacking of Troy to the rape of a woman.
- *Possible additions:* Briefly look at the role of women in other Homeric
  stories like the Iliad and the Odyssey.
- Briefly enumerate the norms of manhood which are displayed or enforced:
  - **Line # `355`:** When Clytemnestra eloquently explains her system of
    messengers and fire beacons, the Herald compares her speech to that of an
    *"prudent man"*.

### How does Clytemnestra challenge and surpass these gender norms?
Through textual evidence, show how Clytemnestra challenges the norms set forth
in *Agamemnon*
  - The signal beacons set up by Clytemnestra, and the scepticism of her news
    at the hands of the Argive townsmen.
  - The "spoken wisely like a man" remark at `351`.
  - Particularly when Clytemnestra chides the Argive townsmen for not
    believing in her at `590`.

### How does Clytemnestra's killing of Agamemnon relate to the role of her gender?
- Examine the pursuit of justice in Homeric literature, and how it is almost
  entirely relegated as a man's pursuit.
  - In the Iliad, it is the men who seek out justice for the kidnapping of
    Helen.
  - Likewise in the Odyssey, it is also Odysseus who enacts revenge upon
    the suitors.
- Show how Clytemnestra acts in contrary to such establishment, and literally
  seeks justice in her own hands.
